THIS IS AN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, SEVERAL FILES ARE FOR REFERENCE AND THERE ARE MANY ERRORS.
FEEL FREE TO BUILD UPON AND REFERENCE SECTIONS AS YOU SEE FIT

NOTES:

embedding_and_indexing.py: This file would contain the functions and code related to generating embeddings and creating an index (if required) for your dataset. It can include the functions for loading data, preprocessing, embedding generation, and indexing.
response_chatbot.py: This file would contain the functions and code for interacting with the chatbot, such as sending user input to the model and receiving responses. It can include the functions for processing user input, calling the appropriate APIs (like GPT-3.5 Turbo), and formatting the responses.
utils.py: file containing utility functions, such as tokenization, cosine similarity, etc., that can be used by both embedding_and_indexing.py and response_chatbot.py.

By organizing the code this way, it will be easier for you or other developers to understand the structure of the project, make changes, or add new features in the future.

SINCERELY,
