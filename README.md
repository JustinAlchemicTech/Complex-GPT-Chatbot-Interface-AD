# Complex Custom GPT JARVIS Chatbot Interface (Active Development)

Active Development Notice
Welcome to this active development project by Alchemic Technology. Please note that this is a work in progress, and as such, you may encounter several reference files and potential errors. We encourage you to build upon and reference sections as you see fit.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several key files and folders, each serving a specific purpose:

Python Files:
embedding_and_indexing.py: This file contains the functions and code related to generating embeddings and creating an index (if required) for your dataset. It includes functions for loading data, preprocessing, embedding generation, and indexing.

response_chatbot.py: This file contains the functions and code for interacting with the chatbot, such as sending user input to the model and receiving responses. It includes functions for processing user input, calling the appropriate APIs (like GPT-3.5 Turbo), and formatting the responses.

utils.py: This file contains utility functions, such as tokenization, cosine similarity, etc., that can be used by both embedding_and_indexing.py and response_chatbot.py.

googledrive_integration.py and quickstart.py: These files contain the code for integrating with Google Drive.

web_crawler_setup.py: This file contains the setup for a web crawler.

HTML Templates:
The project includes several HTML templates for various functionalities of the chatbot:

- Chatbot interface
- Index page
- File listing
- Picker callback
- File upload

JSON Files:
The project uses JSON files for various purposes:

- credentials.json: Contains the credentials for various services.
- embeddings.json: Stores the embeddings generated by the model.
- index.json: Contains the index created for the dataset.

Docker Folder:
The Docker folder contains the setup for MindsDB, a machine learning tool.

By organizing the code this way, it will be easier for you or other developers to understand the structure of the project, make changes, or add new features in the future.
