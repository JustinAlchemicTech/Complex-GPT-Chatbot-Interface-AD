- utils.py: This file contains utility functions, such as tokenization, cosine similarity, etc., that can be used by both embedding_and_indexing.py and response_chatbot.py.

- googledrive.py and quickstart.py: These files contain the code for integrating with Google Drive.

- setting up a web crawler.py: This file contains code for the setup of a web crawler.

<h2> HTML Templates: </h2>
